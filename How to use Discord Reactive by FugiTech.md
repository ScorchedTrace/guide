## Config
A few essential options in https://reactive.fugi.tech/

![](assets/reactFugi/reactFugi_Config.png)
- Include own image in group view: Just toggle it off if you already have your model
![](assets/reactFugi/reactFugi_dim_speaking.gif)
- Dim other's non-speaking image: The default "If matches speaking image" helps with dimming someone's image that doesn't have an open-close states
- Show names: "Hidden" if you want
- Image alignment: In my opinion, if you put your model on the right side, just pick the "right" alignment to always keep your friends' reactive images right beside your model
