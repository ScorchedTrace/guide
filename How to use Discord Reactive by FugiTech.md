	- Should be a good idea to rename the browser source (ie. Reactive Images, FugiTech, Friends, etc)
- Open the browser source's properties and put the copied link into "URL"
- Move the new reactive images source to your desired position
Now you got friends on your stream when doing discord call!ü•≥üéâ
## Config
A few essential options in https://reactive.fugi.tech/
![[librewolf_4SDER4wg74.png]]
- Include own image in group view: Just toggle it off if you already have your model
![[librewolf_KTj2vEUD9g.gif]]
- Dim other's non-speaking image: The default "If matches speaking image" help with dimming someone image that doesn't have an open-close states
- Show names: "Hidden" if you want
- Image alignment: In my opinion, if you put your model on the right side, just pick the "right" alignment to always keep reactive images source right beside your model
